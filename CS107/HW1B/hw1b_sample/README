This directory contains compiled versions of the
two generic container classes you'll be writing.  Some
students prefer to write the mini-web crawler client first,
but in order to do so, they need working binaries of the DArray
and the Hashtable to get anywhere.  Those binaries are right here
for you to use.

Just to see what the adttest client should do, type

make adttest

and then execute 

adttest (or ./adttest)

to see how the adttest client should work.  Beware: typing a make clean 
will rid of the .o files you want to use.  If you accidentally delete
the .o files, then just copy them from the hw1b_sample directory
again.
