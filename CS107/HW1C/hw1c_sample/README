Hi!
In order to use the sample .o's that we supply in this directory, copy
them into your work directory and type

  make rsg

This will compile your *.c files and link them with the .o you just
copied.
Remember that if you do a 'make clean' you will get rid of these .o files
(just need to copy them back again).

NOTE: These binaries are for the SUN SOLARIS platform -- don't try to use
them on AMY's (try SAGAs, EPICs, or ELAINEs).

Happy coding!...
