Assignment 4, Problem 5		 		   Solution by Rob

This PDA takes in any sequence of a's and b's, while pushing these
symbols on its stack. It can never pop a c or d from its stack, as
these symbols will never be pushed. So you can forget about the
transitions with c and d. The PDA will never pop any symbol at all.

Note that PDAs can accept a string even if its stack is not empty.
Therefore it accepts any sequence of a's and b's.
A CFG is
		S -> aS | bS | eps

You can derive this CFG with the method from the book, but this is
needlessly complicated.
