<H3>Prove: if a language is regular then so is its complement.</H3>

Given a regular language L, there must be a DFA that recognizes it.
<P>
Denote that DFA as B, defined formally as B = (Q, E, g, q0, F ) where Q is
the set of states, E is the alphabet, g is the transition function, q0 is
the start state and F is the set of accept states.
<P>
We can take the complement of B, and denote it as B' by changing every
accept state in B to a non accept state, and every non accept state into an
accept state.
<P>
Formally, B' can be denoted as B' = (Q, E, g, q0, F' ), where Q is the same
set of states as in B, E is the same alphabet as in B, g is the same
transition function, and q0 is the same start state... F' changes into Q -
F.
<P>
Any string that ended in a final state in B will not be accepted in B' and
every string that did not end in a final state in B will be accepted by B'.
Thus B' is a DFA that accepts the complement of L.
<P>
Since there is a DFA that recognizes the complement of L, the complement of
L must be a regular language.
<P>
Therefore, if a language is regular then so is its complement.
