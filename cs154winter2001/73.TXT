Problem 3
 
We show that TM equivalence is not recursively enumerable first, since
undecidability follows from that. Assume TM equivalence is recursively
enumerable. Then by theorem 3.13 TM equivalence is recognizable as
well. Now, we can show that ATM is reducible to the complement of TM
equivalence in the following way. Our reducing function takes M and w as
input, where M is a TM and w a string. Let M2 be the TM that rejects
everything. Furthermore, let M3 be the TM that accepts just if M accepts
w. Next, our reducing function runs a non-TM-equivalence test (the
complement of TM equivalence) on the pair <M2,M3>. This test will accept
just if M accepts w, since M2 and M3 will be equivalent just if M does not
accept w. But if we have a function that accepts just if M accepts w, then
that is ATM. So we have a function f that reduces ATM to the complement of
TM equivalence, which implies that the complement of ATM reduces to TM
equivalence. Since the complement of ATM is not recognizable, we know that
TM equivalence is not recognizable, a contradiction. We conclude that TM
equivalence cannot be recursively enumerable.
 
Since TM equivalence is not recognizable, it is surely not decidable,
since decidability implies recognizability.
