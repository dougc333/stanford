Assignment 4, Problem 6		 		   Solution by Rob

Unfortunately I have no time to draw the PDA here, by I can give you a
description. From the initial state it pushes a bottom-of-stack marker
on its stack and proceeds to state A. In state A it reads 0's, while
writing O's on its stack (by means of loop) (thereby counting i). Then
it does an epsilon transition to state B in which it reads 1's while
popping 0's from its stack. By reading the empty-stack marker and
putting it back the PDA now moves to state C, in which it reads 1's
while pushing 1's on its stack. Subsequently, it takes an epsilon
transition to state D in which (by means of yet another loop) it reads
2's while popping 1's from its stack. Finally there is a transition to
the acceptance state (so there are 6 states altogether) that pops the
bottom-of-stack marker.
