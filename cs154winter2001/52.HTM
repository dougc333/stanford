		<h1>Homework 5, Problem 2</h1>

		<p>
		<b>Give an implementation level description of a Turing machine recognizing the language {0^n 1^n 2^n | n >= 0}.</b>
		
		<p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				<i>Check for an empty input.</i>
				<br>
				Check if the current symbol on the tape is _ (the empty space character). If so, accept. 
				This handles the case where n = 0.
			</li>
			
			<p>
			
			<li>
				<i>Ensure that the 0's, 1's, and 2's appear in the proper order.</i>
				<br>
				At this point, we should expect that at least one of each number (0, 1, or 2) exists in the input. If the symbol
				at the start of the tape is not 0, reject. If it is, write _ on the tape as a lefthand marker and enter Stage 1.
				
				<p>
				<b>Stage 1</b>
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 1.
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, enter Stage 2.
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads _, reject.
				
				<p>
				<b>Stage 2</b>
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 2.
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, enter Stage 3.
				<br>
				If the input reads _, reject.
				
				<p>
				<b>Stage 3</b>
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 3.
				<br>
				If the input reads _, continue to the next phase.
				
			</li>
			
			<p>
			
			<li>	
				<i>Rewind back to the start of the tape.</i>
				<br>
				On all numerical inputs, move the head to the left on the tape. Stop on _. Move to the next step.
				
			</li>
			
			<p>
			
			<li>
				<i>Match all 0's in the string.</i>
				<br>Begin by entering Stage 4.

				<p>
				<b>Stage 4</b>
				<br>
				Upon entering Stage 4, if the tape is not at the left end, mark the current position of the head with an X. Do
				nothing if the head is at the left end. Next, move the head to the right.
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 4 (no additional marking).
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, enter Stage 5.
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads _, reject.

				<p>
				<b>Stage 5</b>
				<br>
				Upon entering Stage 5, mark the current position of the head with an X, then move the head right. 
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 5 (no additional marking).
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, enter Stage 6.
				<br>
				If the input reads _, reject.

				<p>
				<b>Stage 6</b>
				<br>
				Upon entering Stage 6, mark the current position of the head with an X, then move the head right. 
				<br>
				If the input reads 0, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 1, reject.
				<br>
				If the input reads 2, move to the right without altering the tape. Remain in Stage 6 (no additional marking).
				<br>
				If the input reads _, go to the next step.

			</li>
		
			<p>
			
			<li>
				<i>Return to the next unmatched 0, if one exists.</i>
				<br>
				Return to the left end of the tape following the process in Step 3 and move right past the left end marker.
				<br>
				If the input is X, move the head to the right.
				<br>
				If the input is 0, repeat the last step.
				<br>
				If the input is 1 or 2, reject.
				<br>
				If the input is _, go to the next step.
			</li>
			
			<p>
			
			<li>
				<i>Verify that all numbers have been matched.</i>
				<br>
				At this point, all 0's have been matched; but there may be additional 1's or 2's remaining.
				On all numerical inputs, reject. If the input is X, move the head to the left. If the input is _, accept.
			</li>
