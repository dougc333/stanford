Using standard laws of first order logic, the formula
<P Align=center>
f<SUB>q0</SUB>(<img src="empty-string.gif" alt="eps">,w) & T =>
<img src="exists.gif" alt="there exists ">x
<img src="exists.gif" alt="there exists ">y: 
f<SUB>q-acc</SUB>(x,y),
</P>
which is the key to the reduction, can be rewritten in the required form.
In particular P => Q can be written as "not P or Q",
"not forall x: P(x)" is equivalent to "exists x: not P(x)", and the
existential quantifiers distribute outwards while renaming bound
variables to be distinct.
