Prove that any problem in P is reducible to any other problem in P:

Given two problems in P, A and B, we define a mapping from A to B as
follows:

First find two strings x and y, such that x is in L(B) and y is not
in L(B).  Of course, this only works if L(B) is not trivial.

Now, we define a Turing machine f to reduce A to B.  f works as follows:
On input w, run an algorithm for A on w.  If the algorithm accepts,
output x.  Otherwise, output y.  f is clearly a many-to-one reduction
from A to B.  Since the algorithm for A is polynomial time, f is
polynomial time.

We have just reduced A to B, for every A and B in P (except, of course,
for the trivial languages).
