Assignment 4, Problem 3		Solution by Rob

S -> AabC
A -> Cc
C -> A | ba | eps

First eliminate epsilon productions:

S -> AabC | Aab
A -> Cc | c
C -> A | ba

Next eliminate unit productions:

S -> AabC | Aab
A -> Cc | c
C -> Cc | c | ba

Then split up long production:

S -> AT | AV
T -> aU
U -> bC
V -> ab
A -> Cc | c
C -> Cc | c | ba

And finally replace terminals by nonterminals:

S -> AT | AV
T -> XU
U -> YC
V -> XY
A -> CZ | c
C -> CZ | c | YX
X -> a
Y -> b
Z -> c

This is in Chomsky normal form.
