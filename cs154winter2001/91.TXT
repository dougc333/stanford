Homework 9. Problem #1. PRIME-TEST

PRIME-TEST is NOT a polynomial time algorithm. The magnitude of the
number, represented in binary or in any other base N notation where
N >= 2 is exponential in the length of that representation. Thus, the
algorithm has to search through an exponential number of potential
divisors in relation to the input causing the PRIME-TEST to be an
exponential time algorithm.

P.S. The algorithm would be polynomial if the input was represented in
unary. This however, is a grossly inefficient way of number
representation, and should not be considered a meaningful possibility.
