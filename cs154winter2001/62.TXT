Assume Utm is decidable by a tm R
 
Use R to construct S
 
S will decide Etm (the emptiness problem).
 
S="On input <M>, an encoding of a tm M
 
1.) Run tm R on <M, the accept state of M>
2.) If the accept state is useless, accept.
3.) else: reject"
 
S decides Etm
 
Etm undecidable
 
contradiction
 
Utm undecidable
