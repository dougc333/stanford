The problem is the following:
Show that the following problem k-PDS is NP-complete: given a family of
sets and a number k, are there k pairwise disjoints sets in the family?
 
Here is my solution:
We are going to show that k-clique on graph G is polynomial reducible to
k-PDS on a family of sets S.
In order to do so, we construct an instance of k-PDS i.e. a family of
sets, and we take the number k of the k-clique. The family of sets consts
of one set for every node in G. The sets {S1 ... Sn}
coresponding to nodes {1 ... n} can be constructed as follows:
 
forall i = 1 ... n
        forall j = 1 ... n such that
        j =/= i and there is no edge between i and j in G
                     i
                add n  to Si and to Sj
                     j
 
This family of sets has the particularity that G is the graph of
independencies between sets if we identify each set with its corresponding
node: two sets are connected by an edge in G iff they are disjoint.
Therefore G has a k-clique iff there is a solution to k-PDS for (S,k).
 
Let's look now at the complexity of the translation from k-clique to
k-PDS:
        - there are n nodes and thus n sets
        - each set consts of at most n elements
        - we assume we can access one node's adjacent edges in constant
time with a good data representation, which is obtained in polynomial time
t(n) from the original input.
 
Therefore, the translation takes time O(t(n) + n^2) which is still
polynomial. It follows that k-PDS is NP-complete because we could show a
polynomial reduction from k-clique which is known to be NP-complete to
k-PDS.
