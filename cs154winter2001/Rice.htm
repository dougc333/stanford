<B>Rice's theorem:</B> Any nontrivial property about the language
recognized by a Turing machine is undecidable. 
<P>
A property about Turing machines can be represented as the language
of all Turing machines, encoded as strings, that satisfy that property.
The property P is <I>about the language recognized by Turing machines</I>
if whenever L(M)=L(N) then P contains (the encoding of) M iff it
contains (the encoding of) N.
The property is non-trivial if there is at least one Turing machine
that has the property, and at least one that hasn't.
<P>
<B>Proof:</B>
Without limitation of generality we may assume that a Turing machine
that recognizes the empty language does not have the property P.
For if it does, just take the complement of P. The undecidability of
that complement would immediately imply the undecidability of P.
<P>
In order to arrive at a contradiction, suppose P is decidable,
i.e. there is a halting Turning machine B that recognizes the
descriptions of Turing machines that satisfy P. Using B we can
construct a Turning machine A that accepts the language
{(M,w)| M is the description of a Turing machine that accepts the string w}.
As the  latter problem is undecidable this will show that B cannot
exists and P must be undecidable as well.
<P>
Let MP be a Turing machine that satisfies P (as P is non-trivial there
must be one). Now A operates as follows:
<OL>
<LI> On input (M,w), create a (description of a) Turing machine C(M,w)
     as follows:
<OL>
<LI> On input x, let the Turing machine M run on the string w
     until it accepts (so if it doesn't accept C(M,w) will run forever).
<LI> Next run MP on x. Accept iff MP does.
</OL>
Note that C(M,w) accepts the same language as MP if M accepts w;
C(M,w) accepts the empty language if M does not accept w.
<BR>
Thus if M accepts w the Turing machine C(M,w) has the property P, and
otherwise it doesn't.
<LI> Feed the description of C(M,w) to B.
     If B accepts, accept the input (M,w); if B rejects, reject.
</OL>
