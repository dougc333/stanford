Solution to the extra credit problem assignment 4
 
 You were asked to prove that every 1-letter CFL is also regular. This can
be easily be proved by converting the CFG for the given 1 letter CFL into
a right linear (or for that matter a left linear) grammar. A right linear
grammar is one where all productions are of the special form
			   X->a or X-->aY.
 But since the hint asked to use the pumping lemma, I will present a proof
based on the pumping lemma.
If the 1-letter language is a CFL, by the pumping lemma there is a pumping
constant p, such that all strings whose length is greater than p can
be pumped. The number of strings of length less than p happens to be finite. 
So L(<p) is a finite language. Consider the fragment of the L 
where all strings are of length >=p.
Let q be any string in this fragment. q can be written as uvwxy ,
s.t. 0<|vx|<p. for all i,
  uv(^i)wx(^i)y is also in L(>p). Since a is the only letter in the
language, the sub-language "generated " by this string can be written as
a^(M) (a^N)*. Which is regular and N <p. But the only problem is that we
may end up with an infinite number of possibilities for M and regular
languages are NOT closed under infinite union.
To take care of this, consider the language Li,j as a^i (a^j)* where
0<=i<j<=p. There are O(p^2) such languages. Any a^M(a^N)* can be written
as
   L(M mod N),N - { a finite number of strings}.
 
Now the infinite union over infinite LM,N leads to a finite union over
some of the L(i,j)s minus an infinite intersection of a series of finite
languages. Countable intersection of finite languages remains finite.
So we have proved (although sketchily) that any 1-letter CFL is actually
regular.
 
Surprisingly enough, most of the people who attempted it gave an
acceptable proof. Two of you got it entirely correct.
