<p>Solutions to problem 5 . Assignment 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Let L be a non-empty regular language and M be the DFA with minimum
number of states accepting L. Let M contain n states.</p>
<p>Since L is non-empty L has at least one string. Let us for sake of
contradiction assume that all strings accepted by M had length &gt;=n. Therefore
if w is the minimum length string in L, |w| &gt;=n. Also note that n happens to
be the same as &quot;p&quot; for the pumping lemma, i.e., it is the number s.t.
for any string whose length is greater than it, the string can be pumped. So w
can be pumped. We pump w down once to get a string w' of length less than w
which is in the language. Thus we conclude that w cannot be pumped. In other
words the minimum length string must have length &lt; p or n.</p>
