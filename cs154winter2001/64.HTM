<b>Problem 4</b><br><br>
<i>
Consider the variant of the PCP, in which the dominos are colored red or 
green, and a valid matching must be an alternating sequence of red and 
green dominos. Show that this problem is undecidable.</i>
<br><br>
<dd>
This can be done by reduction from the original PCP. Let us call the 
question above CPCP (Colored PCP). Assume that CPCP is decidable.<br>
<dd>
We will show that a decidable CPCP also leads to a decidable PCP. To do 
so, select any collection of dominos as described by the PCP. Then create 
two such collections, such that all the dominos in one are colored red, and 
in the other green. Combine these two collections into a single collection.<br>
<dd>
This is a valid collection of dominos for the CPCP. Since we have 
assumed the CPCP to be decidable, we are then able to decide whether there 
exists a sequence of dominos from the collection such that the top and 
bottom match and the colors alternate.<br>
<dd>
Additionally, our collection of dominos (created in this manner) will 
always contain both a green and a red version of each domino. This means 
that any sequence of dominos (that form the same top/bottom strings) can 
be recreated in such a way that the colors alternate. We could just pick 
the first domino to be red, and replace each following domino by its red 
or green version, as dictated by alternating.
<dd>
As a result, if there exists a sequence where the top and bottom match, 
then there also exists a sequence where the top and bottom match and the 
colors alternate. Therefore in the special case of our collection, the 
statement of the CPCP can be reduced to deciding whether there exists a 
sequence of dominos such that the top and bottom match. Since the dominos 
in the original collection and in the new one have the same values, they 
can only be used to create equivalent strings. Therefore if the CPCP can 
be decided for the new collection, then we can find for the original 
collection whether there exists a sequence of dominos such that the top 
and bottom match.<br>
<dd>
This is exactly the statement of the PCP problem, which Sipser proves 
undecidable on p.183-189. However since any collection of dominos can in 
this way be recreated into a CPCP then having a decidable CPCP causes a 
contradiction. Therefore CPCP is also not decidable.
