    <p align="center">CS244b Assignment #1<br>
    Instructor: David Cheriton<br>
    Assigned: Tuesday, March 30, 1999<br>
    Design Due: Monday, April 12, 1999<br>
    Due: Friday, April 23, 1999<br>
    <br>
    We estimate that this assignment will require about 25 hours of work, so please plan
    ahead! </p>
    <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="arial black, arial, helvetica">1. Introduction<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to get you to understand the key notions of shared
    memory consistency and distributed interprocess synchronization, protocols for
    implementing these, and the performance, reliability and usability issues with distributed
    shared memory.<br>
    <br>
    To this end, you are to extend a simple distributed shared memory system that can be used
    with simple applications running in parallel across at least three machines, and collect
    some basic performance measurements from running this software. </p>
    <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="arial black, arial, helvetica">2. Starting Point<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
    <p>The relevant distributed shared memory issues, techniques and protocols are discussed
    in Chapter 2 of the reader and in the Li/Hudak and TreadMarks papers. </p>
    <p>You are provided with a simple C++ implementation of a DSM, as well as some sample
    applications (see <tt>/usr/class/cs244b/shared-memory</tt>). Your first objective should
    be to familiarize yourself with the code, run the sample applications, and become
    comfortable with the workings of the system.<br>
    <br>
    A tutorial is scheduled for Friday, April 2 (11:00-11:50) to review the assignment,
    discuss the provided code and answer questions. You should read the relevant material and
    look over the given code in advance of this tutorial. </p>
    <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="arial black, arial, helvetica"><a name="submit">3. What to submit</a><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
    <p>The first deadline is for submission of the design for your modifications. It is
    sufficient to submit a state diagram for the client and server.</p>
    <p>For the final deadline, you must submit the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The final design for your modifications. You should justify any changes that you made
        from your initial design submission.</li>
      <li>The code for each modification. You should clearly indicate your modifications in the
        code. You should also supply a README file for each modification that outlines the code
        changes that you made for that modification.</li>
      <li>For each modification (where appropriate), a concise description of the consistency and
        syncronization protocols that you implemented, and how they interact. </li>
      <li>A description of the performance of your distributed shared memory system and
        applications, including: <!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

        <!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="arial, helvetica">
      </li>
      <li>Your recommendation of when to use distributed shared memory, any caveats on its use,
        and the effect of different page sizes, network speeds, memory sizes and processor speeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition, you will receive a short list of design questions by email a few days
    after you submit your assignment. These questions will require you to write a short
    paragraph about how you solved two or three key design issues. You will also have to give
    references to the locations in the code where these solutions are implemented. The entire
    solution to these design questions needn't exceed a page in length. You will have 48 hours
    from the receipt of these questions to email back your answers. </p>

    <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="arial black, arial, helvetica">5. Working in groups<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
    <p>You should work individually if you only do the base assignment. You can work in groups
    of 2 or 3 if you do significant extensions beyond the basic assignment, in applications,
    protocols and measurement, that reflect the additional capacity of the group. In this
    case, you only submit one copy per group with group members indicated in the README file. <br>
    <br>
    Below you will find a list of &quot;Basic Modifications&quot;. All students, including
    those working individually must complete these modifications. Below you will also find a
    list of &quot;Assignment Extension Suggestions&quot;. These are not required of those who
    do the assignment individually. Groups of two will be required to implement two extensions
    in addition to the Required Modifications in order to obtain full credit. Groups of three
    are required to complete Extension D below in addition to the Required Modifications to
    obtain full credit. Students may also suggest extensions, provided that they are
    pre-approved no less than one week in advance of the due date by one of the TAs. </p>
