LECTURE NOTES - Temporal Databases
=========================================================================

Storing and querying inherently temporal data in a conventional
relational DBMS can be painful and inefficient.

  - Oracle's DATE type is not enough.

  - There is an active field of research called "temporal databases"
    to address the problems.


Ex: Database of prescription information: patient, drug, start date,
    end date.

CREATE TABLE P (patient string, drug string, start DATE, end DATE)

Q: What is key for table?





Ex query: Who was taking "Ceclor" on 5/15/00?












Ex query: Has anyone ever taken "Ceclor" and "Bactrim" at the same
          time?












Ex query: For how long altogether has "Mary" taken "Ceclor"














Ex query: Who has taken "Ceclor" for the longest time?












Ex query: Who is taking "Ceclor" now?












Ex query: Who will have taken "Ceclor" the longest a week from now,
assuming the currently active prescriptions remain active?





A Temporal Relational Model
===========================

New attribute type called TIMESTAMP.

A TIMESTAMP is a set of disjoint INTERVALS.

An INTERVAL is a start and end TIME.

A TIME is either a fixed point in time, the special symbol "NOW", or a
"NOW-relative" time (e.g., NOW + 7days).

Special operations on TIMESTAMPS:

Overlaps(T1, T2), Contains(T1, T2), Start(T), Length(T), etc.


New version of prescriptions table:

CREATE TABLE P (patient string, drug string, time TIMESTAMP)

Example tuple: ("Sue", "Ceclor", {[5/1/00-5/4/00],[5/12/00-NOW]})

Q: What is key for table?









Temporal Relational Algebra
===========================

* Can use special operators as above in SELECT conditions and PROJECT
  lists.

* Special interpretation for PROJECT: coalesce timestamps.

Ex: PROJECT[drug, time](P)










* Special interpretation for JOIN: implicit TIMESTAMP intersection
  (see example below)

Ex query: Who was taking "Ceclor" on 5/15/00?








Ex query: Has anyone ever taken "Ceclor" and "Bactrim" at the same
          time?








Ex query: For how long altogether has "Mary" taken "Ceclor"








Ex query: Who is taking "Ceclor" now?








There is a proposed standard called TSQL2 that incorporates these
kinds of temporal operations (and many many others) into SQL.

Ex: Moving-window aggregate
