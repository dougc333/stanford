The procedure for turning in this assignment is the same as for prior
assignments, and please remember the strictly enforced <a
href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~widom/cs145/info.html#late">late
policy</a>.

<p><i>Please save a copy of your final relational schema (part (g)),
as it will be needed for subsequent project parts.</i>

In this second part of the project, you will produce a relational
schema from the entity-relationship diagram you came up with in PDA
Part 1.  In the following project part, you will create an actual
database from this schema using the Oracle DBMS.

<ul>

<b>(a)</b> Please attach a copy of your E/R diagram from PDA Part 1.
If you would like to make changes to your original E/R diagram at this
point (due to TA feedback or any other reason), you may do so.  The
new E/R design will not be graded but will be used as a basis for
grading the next part of this assignment.

<p><b>(b)</b> Using the method for translating an E/R diagram to
relations, produce a set of relations for your database design.  As
usual, please be sure to underline key attributes in your relations.

<p><b>(c)</b> For each relation in your schema, specify a set of completely
nontrivial functional dependencies for the relation.  Any functional
dependencies that actually hold in the real-world scenario that you're
modeling should be specified, or should follow from the specified
dependencies.  Don't worry if you find that some of your relations
have no nontrivial functional dependencies.

<p><b>(d)</b> Is each relation in your schema in Boyce-Codd Normal
Form (BCNF) with respect to the functional dependencies you specified?
If not, decompose the relation into smaller relations so that each
relation is in BCNF.  Be sure to underline key attributes in your new
relations.

<p><b>(e)</b> Are there any non-trivial multivalued dependencies that
hold on any of the relations in your schema?  (You needn't consider
MVD's that are also functional dependencies.)  If so, specify the
multivalued dependencies, then decompose the relations into smaller
ones so that each one is in Fourth Normal Form (4NF).  Be sure to
underline key attributes in your new relations.

<p><b>(f)</b> Now that you've decomposed your relations as far as
possible, are there any relations that could be <i>combined</i>
without introducing redundancy (i.e., without creating BCNF or 4NF
violations)?  If so, combine them.

<p><b>(g)</b> Is there anything you still don't like about the schema
(e.g., attribute names, relation structure, etc.)?  If so, modify the
relational schema to something you prefer.  You will be working with
this schema quite a bit, so it's worth spending some time now to make
sure you're happy with it.

</ul> 

<b>SAVE A COPY OF YOUR FINAL SCHEMA - YOU WILL NEED IT FOR SUBSEQUENT
PROJECT PARTS.</b>
