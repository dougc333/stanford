<p><b>Question:</b>
 I have a relation that has multiple keys. (For
 example, in relation <tt>Student(SS#,name,address)</tt>, it could be that
 <tt>(name,address)</tt> is one key and <tt>SS#</tt> is another.)  What
 should I do?

<p><b>Answer:</b>
 Multiple keys do occur in practice.  In the relational model there is no
 way to specify multiple keys: you can only underline one set of
 attributes as the key.  If there are other keys that you would like to
 mention, make a separate note.  When you get around to creating actual
 relations in an actual DBMS, there is a way to specify more than one
 key.
