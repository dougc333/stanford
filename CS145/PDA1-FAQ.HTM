<b>Question:</b> When you say the E/R diagram should have "in the
range of five or so entity sets, and a similar number of relationship
sets", what exactly do you mean?

<p><b>Answer:</b> Shoot for somewhere between 3 and 10.  You'll sense if
your design is too simple or too complex.

<b>Question:</b> What kind of data will I be loading into my database?

<p><b>Answer:</b> You'll actually create two databases, a small one
(10's of entities/relationships) and a large one (1000's or 10,000's
of entities/relationships).  Many students find that it only makes
sense for their small database to contain realistic data, while the
large one is made up of synthetic (computer-generated fake) data.  If
you have an application where you can get a large amount of real data,
all the better, but it's not necessary.

<b>Question:</b> I'm completely at a loss to think of an application.
Any suggestions?

<p><b>Answer:</b> Take a look at any Web shopping site.  They all have a
similar theme: products, customers, orders, shopping baskets, etc.
They typically make for an interesting and appropriately sized
application.

<b>Question:</b> Written assignment #1 asks me to create a schema for
a Web site of my choosing.  I'm doing essentially the same thing for
my PDA.  Can I turn in the same solution for both?

<p><b>Answer:</b> Yes, no problem.  Be sure to follow the instructions in
each assignment carefully though.

<p><b>Question:</b>
 I have an entity set that has multiple keys. (For
 example, in entity set <tt>Student</tt>, it could be that
 <tt>(name,address)</tt> is one key and <tt>SS#</tt> is another.)  What
 should I do?

<p><b>Answer:</b>
 Multiple keys do occur in practice.  In an entity set in the E/R
 model there is no
 way to specify multiple keys: you can only underline one set of
 attributes as the key.  If there are other keys that you would like to
 mention, make a separate note.  When you get around to creating actual
 relations in an actual DBMS, there is a way to specify more than one
 key.
