  <LI>The <I>clique problem</I> --- does a given graph <I>G</I> have a clique 
  (set of nodes with all possible edges between any two of them present) of size 
  <I>k</I> --- is NP-complete. Prove this fact by reducing the problem IS 
  (independent set, as discussed in Section 10.4.2) to the clique problem. A <A 
  href="http://www-db.stanford.edu/~ullman/hmu/hint71.html">Hint</A> is 
  available. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Suppose there are polynomial-time reductions from problem <I>A</I> to 
  problem <I>B</I>, from <I>B</I> to <I>C</I>, and from <I>D</I> to <I>C</I>. 
  Let <I>S</I> be the subset of <I>{A,B,C,D}</I> that have polynomial-time 
  algorithms. What are all the possible subsets <I>S</I> could be? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>(This is easy; don't look for anything deep.) Let <I>Q</I> be the property 
  of RE languages <I>L</I>: ``<I>L</I> is in NP but not in <I>P</I>.'' Prove 
  that <I>Q</I> is decidable if and only if P=NP. Remember to prove both 
  directions of the ``if and only if.'' 
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>SAT100</I> is the satisfiability problem restricted to expressions with 
  at most 100 variables. What can you say about the NP-completeness of SAT100? 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Prove that if the complement of even one NP-complete problem is in NP, 
  then NP = co-NP (and therefore the complement of every NP-complete problem is 
  in NP). </LI></OL></BODY></HTML>
