Here is the solution to the problem I worked in the first section. Your
proofs should be roughly equivalent in terms of thoroughness.


problem 2.4, pg. 48 of the textbook

Suppose d is the transition function for a DFA. Prove that for any input
strings x and y, d(q, xy) = d(d(q, x), y). [Hint: use induction on |y|]

Basis
-----
Let y be the empty string, so |y| = 0.

	xy = x, so d(q, xy) = d(q,x)

	d(q, empty string) = q, so d(d(q, x), y) = d(q, x)

Since both terms reduce to the same term, we have proved our basis:

	d(q, xy) = d(d(q, x), y), where y is the empty string


Inductive step
--------------
Assume d(q, xw) = d(d(q,x), w) for all strings w, where |w| < n for some
integer n > 0.  [inductive hypothesis]

We know we have two main pieces to work with here: our inductive
hypothesis, and the definition of the transition function:

	d(q, wa) = d(d(q, w), a)

First step: rewrite y as
	
	y = wa

where |y| = n, a is the last symbol in y, and w is the remainder of y.

We seek to prove

	d(q, xy) = d(d(q, x), y)

Starting with the left side and substituting in:

	d(q, xy) = d(q, xwa)
	         = d(d(q, xw), a)       [def. of transition function]
	         = d(d(d(q, x), w), a)  [inductive hypothesis]

We then tackle the other term:

	d(d(q, x), y) = d(d(q, x), wa)
	              = d(d(d(q, x), w) a)   [def. of transition function]

Since both sides expand to the same term, they are equal. 


By induction,

	d(q, xy) = d(d(q, x), y)

QED.


comments
--------
For this proof, as in most others, the formality requirements constrain
you to a small set of definitions, hypotheses, and standard mathematical
operations. This actually makes thing easier, insofar as there are only so
many things you can try. In this case, the proof requires only two
substantial building blocks - the definition of the transition function
and the inductive hypothesis.

If you watch the video of Friday's section, you can see me fumbling around
a bit at the end of the proof. So it is actually very common to lose track
of where you are in a proof. But if you just keep in mind your goal and
the tools you have to get there, you should be able to generate a solution.
