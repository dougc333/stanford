<h3>
<LI> Relational Logic: Syntax (8 points)</h3>
Given the following list of variables and constants:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variables:&nbsp; x, y, z
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object constants:&nbsp; rover,
fido, mousy, spots

<h3>
<LI> English Translation (12 points)</h3>
Translate each of the following English sentences into an equivalent sentence
in relational logic. Use only the relation and object constants given in each part
and you can introduce your own variables if necessary.  You are also
allowed to use Existential and Universal quantifiers.
<p>(a) All start-ups in Silicon Valley succeed.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object constants:&nbsp; siliconValley

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relational constants with an
arity
of two: in(Object, Place)

<p>(b) There is no spoon.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relational constants with an arity
of one:&nbsp; spoon

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relational constants with an
arity

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object constants:&nbsp; i
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relational constants with an arity of one: candy,
hungry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relational constants with an arity of two:
&nbsp;&nbsp; preferToEat( person, thing ), willEat( person, thing )

<p>(f)You can fool some people all of the time, and you can fool all of
the people sometime, but you can't fool all the people all of the time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relational constants with an arity of two:&nbsp;&nbsp;fool( person, time )

<h3>
<LI>Blocks World (15 points)</h3>
Consider the following block world:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +---+
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | ! |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +---+
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | @ |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +---+ +---+ +---+
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | * | | + | | % |
&nbsp;---+---+-+---+-+---+---</pre>
Given the following syntax:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variables: x, y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objext constants: a, b, c, d, e
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relational constants with an arity of one: clear, onTable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relational constants with an arity of two: on, over

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear(x) means block x is clear; there are no blocks on top of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onTable(x) means block x is on the table.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on(x,y) means block x is stacked directly on top of block y.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over(x,y) means block x is above y on the same stack.</pre>
Using the universe of discourse <tt>|i| = {!, @, %, *, +}</tt>, where each
symbol represents the labeled blocks, give an interpretation that represents
this state of the world.

<h3>
<LI>Distinguishing Models (16 points)</h3>
Two interpretations are indistiguishable models if they cannot be distinguished
by any set of sentences. That is, the two interpretations satisfy the exact
same set of sentences. Thus, if there is a sentence that is satisfied by
one interpretation but not another, the two are distinguishable.
<p>For each of the following pairs of interpretations, say whether the
pair is distinguishable or indistinguishable. If you answer "distinguishable,"
then supply a single relational logic sentence that distinguishes the two
interpretations.
<p>Note: Variables are allowed.
<p>(a)

<h3>
<LI>Models, Entailment (10 points)</h3>
In the following, assume "entails" to mean "relationally entails." We also
use <tt>U</tt> and <tt>^</tt> to represent set union and intersection,
respectively.
<p>Let S and T be sets of sentences, and let phi and psi be sentences in
relational logic. State whether each of the following statements are true
or false.
<p>(a) If <tt>S</tt> entails <tt>phi</tt> and <tt>T</tt> entails
<tt>psi</tt>,
then <tt>S U T</tt> entails <tt>(phi &amp; psi)</tt>
<p>
<p>(b) If <tt>S</tt> entails <tt>phi</tt> and <tt>T</tt> entails
<tt>phi</tt>,
then <tt>S ^ T</tt> entails <tt>phi</tt>
<p>(c) If <tt>S</tt> entails <tt>phi</tt> then <tt>S U T</tt> cannot entail
<tt>~phi</tt>.
<p>
<p>(d) If <tt>S U T</tt> is <tt>{}</tt>, then <tt>S U T</tt> does not entail
any sentence <tt>phi</tt>.
<p>
<p>(e) If <tt>S</tt> logically entails <tt>phi</tt> and

<H3><LI> Models And Interpretations (12 points)</H3> 
<PRE>
    Parts (a) and (b) refer to the following syntax: 


    variables :         x, y, z
    object constants :  a, b, c
    Unary Relational :  p
    Binary Relational : q
    
In the following questions, use the universe of discourse |i| = {*,#,@}. 

(a) For each of the following sentences of relational logic, give an interpretation that 
    is a model for that sentence. 


	1. q(x,a) & q(a,y) => q(x,y)

	2. p(x) => p(b)
 
	3. ( ~p(a) & ~q(b,c) ) <=> ~( p(x) | q(y,z) ) 

(b) For each sentence in part (a), find an interpretation that satisfies the sentence but 
    is not a model. Indicate this by providing: 
	(i) the interpretation, 
 	(ii) a variable assignment for which the interpretation does satisfy the sentence, 
	and 
 	(iii) a variable assignment for which the interpretation does not satisfy the 
	      sentence. If such an interpretation is not possible, state "Not Possible" 
	      and briefly (in one or two sentences) explain why. 

</PRE>

<H3> <LI> Geometry (12 Points) </h3>
<PRE>
Consider the Plane as a collection of all it's points. Define an Object to be a set 
of such points. Assume an interpretation I whose Universe of Discourse is the set of 
all Objects, and which associates the following meanings to the following relational 
constants:

p(x) means "x is a point"
l(x) means "x is a line"
c(x) means "x is a circumference"
i(x,y) means "x intersects y", i.e. x and y have at least one point in common.

(a) Consider the binary relational constant e. Let the interpretation of e(x,y) be 
    "x is equal to y". Give a sentence which use only the four relational constants 
    above, but not e, which has the same truth value as e(x,y) under every variable 
    assignment.

	[Hint: Two objects are equal iff they are made of the exactly the same points.]

(b) Consider the ternary relational constant t. Let the interpretation of t(x,y,z) 
    be "x, y and z lie on one line" if x, y and z are points. The interpretation when 
    one of them isn't a point doesn't matter. Assume t(x,y,z) to be true if two among 
    x, y and z are equal. Give a sentence using the four original relational constants 
    and e, which has the same truth value as t(x,y,z) under every variable assignment.

	[Hint: Think about the two lines, one connecting x to y, the other connecting
                y to z.]

(c) Give a sentence using the original four relational constants, together with e and t, 
    whose truth value is the same as: 
	For each triple (x,y,z) of points that don't lie on a line,
	there is one and only one circumference passing through x, y and z.

	[Hint: separate the existence and uniqueness.]
</PRE>
<H3> <LI> Family (15 Points) </h3>
<PRE>
Assume an interpretation I whose Universe of Discourse is the set of all people.
Introduce a Unary function constant father, where father(x) is the father of a person x.
Introduce a binary relation constant parent, such that parent(x,y) means that y is 
a parent of x. Introduce one last binary relation same, such that same(x,y) means that
x and y are the same person.

(a) Introduce constants zoe and eitan. Write a sentence to express the fact
    that eitan's father is zoe's father's son.
	
(b) Write a sentence that captures the fact that a person's father is a parent.

(c) Introduce a constant danny. Write a sentence to express the fact
    that danny has no siblings.

(d) Introduce the binary relational constant ismother. Let the interpretation of
    of ismother(x,y) be "y is the mother of x". Construct a sentence, using the 
    above defined functional and relational constants, that has the same truth 
    value as ismother(x,y) under any variable assignment (Assume everyone has exactly
    one mother and one father as parents).

(e) Introduce the binary relational constant cousin. Let the interpretation of 
    cousin(x,y) be "x and y are first cousins" (Nobody is their own cousin).   
    Construct a sentence, using the above defined functional and relational constants, 
    that has the same truth value as cousin(x,y) under any variable assignment.
