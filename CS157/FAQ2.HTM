<H2>Problem Set 2 FAQ</H2>
<HR>
<h2>
General:
</h2>
<h3>When is the problem set due?</h3>
It's due midnight on Thursday, April 27th. Technically Friday, April
28th.
<p>
<HR>
<h2>
Problem 1:
</h2>
<h3>On 1d, is the "if" intentionally there?</h3>
No.  It is a typo and has now been removed.
<h3> On 1e, "friendly" has not been defined for us.</h3>
"friendly" has intentionally been left undefined.
<h3> On 1g, "pet" has not been defined for us.</h3>
This is a typo.  It should be a relational constant with arity of
one.  The current web page has been updated with this information.  
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 2: </h2>
<h3>Are we allowed to use Existential and Universal quantifiers?</h3>
Yes.
<h3>On part c, do you mean all kings play chess on all finely grained sand? Or that there are some
kings who play chess on some finely grained sand?</h3>
It should be interpreted this way: if any king comes across a chess board on any patch of finely
grained sand, as long as the weather is nice, he'll start playing chess.
<p>
<HR>
<h2>Problem 3: </h2>
<h3>Do you want just an interpretation or a variable assignment as
well?</h3>
Just an interpretation is fine.
<p>
<HR>
<h2>Problem 4: </h2>
<h3>Are we allowed to use existentials in our sentences?</h3>
<b>No.</b> We have been a bit unclear about what we are calling relational
logic, so we've been lenient with the use of existentials, but for this
particular problem, it is really only interesting if we stick to allowing
variables, but without quantifiers. In other words, your sentences should
not contain 'A' or 'E'. We assume universal quantification for all
variables. So don't use existentials.
<p>
<HR>
<h2>Problem 5: </h2>
<h3>Do you mean "let phi and psi be sentences in relational logic" instead
of "phi and t"?</h3>
Yes, that was a mistake. It has been fixed.
<p>
<h3>What interpretations satisfy the empty set of sentences?</h3>
All interpretations satisfy the empty set of sentences.  No
interpretations satisfy a set of unsatisfiable sentences.
