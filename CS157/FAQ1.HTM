<h2>
Problem 2:
</h2>
<h3>Does "either... or" mean inclusive or or exclusive or?</h3>
The original problem set posting had an error. The sentence example for
question 2 was written "It is either raining or snowing".  The correct
sentence is "It is raining or snowing", as it now appears on the problem
set. Also, in part c) "Either" can be interpretted as inclusive or
exclusive or.  Both possible interpretations will be accepted.
<p>
<h2>Problem 5: </h2>
<h3>What are you asking for?</h3>
To illustrate the question, consider the sentence (p & q) | (p &
~f).  Then perhaps # can represent the sentence as ((p #
p)#q)#(f#q).  This is incorrect, but the idea is to
express a logically equivalent sentence using only the operator #.
<p>
<h2>Problem 10:</h2>
<h3>Do the premises we write have to represent the sentences given
exactly?</h3>
The premises you create DO NOT have to be exact representations of the
informative sentences.  For example, from the sentence "A Taibo is cute.",
you could assume the premise p where p is a logical constant representing
the proposition that "the silver Taibo is cute."  Since it is not
necessary to encode all the information in the text, this is perfectly
acceptable.  Also, each premise should rely on only one bullet
point.
