                   The EtherLink 10 ISA NIC Family
                    NDIS 2 Driver and Windows 95


The only reason choose the NDIS 2 driver over the NDIS3/NDIS4 drivers is
because you must use some network component that requires a DOS-based
NDIS 2 interface.

On a new install on a computer running Windows 95, follow the directions
given to install the NDIS3/NDIS4 drivers in Windows 95 (W95NDIS3.TXT).
Then follow the steps below to change from the NDIS3/NDIS4 driver to the
NDIS2 driver.

1.  In Windows 95, click Start, Settings, and then Control Panel.

2.  Select the Network icon, then select the NIC in the configuration box,
    and click Properties.

3.  In the Driver Type tab, change the "Protect mode (32 bit) NDIS Driver"
    to "Real Mode (16 bit) NDIS Driver".  Press "OK", then press "OK" again
    to close the network configuration window.

4.  Windows 95 will than prompt for a reboot.  Pick "Yes".  When the
    Windows 95 boots, it will be using the NDIS 2 driver.
