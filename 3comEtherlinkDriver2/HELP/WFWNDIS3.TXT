-------------------------------------
The following describes the procedure for installing the protected-mode

    Insert the EtherDisk #2 diskette in drive A:, and type the following
    path for the location of the NDIS driver:

    The Network Setup screen now lists the NIC, along with the
    default protocol stacks:

    3Com EtherLink 10 ISA (3C509b) (NDIS2/NDIS3)

8.  The Windows Setup program asks if you want to replace the Enhanced
    Mode Protocol Manager with the version you are installing now.
    Click Yes to All.

    Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Disk 7 and click OK.
