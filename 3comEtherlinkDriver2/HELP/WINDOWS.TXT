                        3Com (R) Corporation
                     EtherDisk (R) Diskette for
               The 3C509B EtherLink 10 ISA NIC Family
                 Windows Installation Information


Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups (WFW)
-------------------------------------------
If NetWare is the network operating system, then the 3Com Intelligent Auto
Install program (COMSLINK.EXE) on EtherDisk #2 can be used to install for
DOS, DOS\WFW, or DOS\Windows3x.  The Intelligent Auto install program will
install a DOS ODI client for Netware environments.

For non-NetWare environments, install the client software as specified by
your network operating system vendor. WFW has internal support for Microsoft
workgroup networking environment.


Windows 95/98
-------------
EtherDisk 6.1 contains a new GUI-based installer and post install helper.
To use this new software, run PREINSTL.EXE on EtherDisk #2 PRIOR to
installing the EtherLink 10 ISA NIC.  PREINSTL will prepare Windows 95/98
to accept importing software from EtherDisk #1.  Follow the instructions
given by PREINSTL when it completes.  Refer to the Windows 95/98 installation
information on this EtherDisk for more detail.

Windows NT
----------
Care must be taken when installing Windows NT because both Microsoft and
3Com provide a driver and NT installation file for the EtherLink 10 ISA.
Microsoft's driver ships with NT and 3Com's driver ships on the EtherDisk.
However, 3Com's driver will provide faster, more reliable service.

To install and use the 3Com Windows NT driver, refer to the Windows NT
installation information on this EtherDisk.

Windows 2000
------------
This version of the EtherDisk (v6.1) does not contain a driver for Windows
2000.  A driver is provided with Windows 2000 that supports the 3C509B.
