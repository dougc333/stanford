                 The EtherLink 10 ISA Adapter Family
            NetWare 4.11 Server Driver Installation Notes


This file contains information for installing the ODI server driver into a
NetWare version 4.11, 4.10, and 3.12 servers.  You can install this driver
by using the EtherDisk install program to copy the driver to the server's
hard disk, and then manually loading the driver.

Alternatively, you can import this driver when installing the NetWare 4.11
and NetWare 4.10 server software.  This driver can be used in NetWare 4.10
and NetWare 3.12 servers with the appropriate .NLM support.  Installing
this driver in NetWare 3.12 servers is documented later in this file.

This server driver does not support NetWare 4.0X and NetWare 3.11.  If you
need a driver for either of those two servers, download the compatible
driver from 3Com's web site.


Installing the Server Driver into a NetWare 4.11 and NetWare 4.10 Servers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To import this server driver into a NetWare 4.1X server, follow these steps:

1.  Run the server installer.  Choose the driver option. Choose the
    configure network drivers option.  Choose select a driver option.
    When the driver list appears, press the Insert key.  The installer will
    prompt you for the driver path.  Press F3.

2.  Enter A:\NWSERVER for the path.  The installer will read the diskette
    #2 and display "3C5X9.LAN 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA Family driver v4.0".
    Press enter.

3.  The installer asks "Do you want to copy this driver?".  Enter yes.
    Next, the installer will prompt you for the disposition of the existing
    driver and LDI file.  Choose "yes" if you want to save the old files.
    The installer copies the driver and install file from the diskette.
    The installer then steps to the configure network driver menu.
    menu.

4.  Choose the "select/modify driver parameters and protocols" option, then
    move the cursor to the first (top most) item in the configuration
    window.  The question is "Is this a <legacy ISA card model num>?".  If
    the NIC is a 3C509B with Plug 'n Play enabled, choose "NO".  If the NIC
    is a 3C509, 3c509B with Plug 'n Play disabled, choose "YES".


5.  Next, you must set the slot number.  The slot number is set by the
    operating system, so do the following to determine the slot number.
    Press alt-escape to return to the operating system menu.  At the
    command line, enter LOAD 3C5X9.  When the driver loads, a message
    specifying the slot number will appear.  Make note of the slot number,
    then enter escape to abort the load driver command. Press Alt-Esc to
    return to the installer. Enter the slot number secured in the previous
    step.

6.  For best performance, set the Parallel tasking control to "YES".

7.  Make any other configuration and protocol changes that are appropriate
    for your server, then go to the "save parameters and load driver"
    option.  At this point, installation is complete.

NOTE: You must have the Novell supplied NLM files to support the use
      of this driver in NetWare 4.10.  At the time this EtherDisk was
      developed, the file name is LANDR9.EXE.  This file is available
      at Novell's web site (www.novell.com).

Installing the Server Driver into a NetWare 3.12 Server
------------------------------------------------------

This file explains how to install the ODI server driver on this diskette
into a NetWare 3.12 server.  The NetWare 3.12 installation program does not
have driver import capability.  Therefore, the following procedure assumes
the NetWare server software is already installed but not yet running.
You must have the Novell supplied NLM files to support the use of this driver
in NetWare 3.12.  At the time this EtherDisk was developed, the file name is
LANDR9.EXE.  This file is available at Novell's web site (www.novell.com).

To install this server driver into a NetWare 3.12 server, either use the
program on this diskette or manually copy the files to the server's hard
disk.  To manually install the driver, proceed as follows:

1.  Copy the 3C5X9.LAN file from the \NWSERVER subdirectory on
    EtherDisk #2 to the server hard disk.

2.  Boot the server and launch the installer.

3.  Edit the AUTOEXEC.NCF file to add the following line (assuming the
    server start directory is C:\SERVER, where the LAN drivers and NLM files
    were copied):

    LOAD C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN PNP SLOT=<Slot Number>
    LOAD C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN ISA PORT=<I/O base address>

    Use the PNP parameter if you are installing a 3C509B ISA NIC with Plug
    'n Play enabled.  Enter ISA if you are installing a 3C509B with Plug 'n
    Play disabled, or a 3C509 NIC.  The SLOT parameter is the
    slot number assigned by the NBI module.  This can be determined by
    loading the driver without parameters and examining the slot number
    assigned by NBI.  In the non-PnP case, the PORT number is the I/O base
    address of the 3C509 NIC.

Multiple Adapters
-----------------

To support more than one adapter in a server, change the AUTOEXEC.NCF file
to the format shown below:

load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN ISA PORT=300 NAME=<name1> FRAME=<frametype>
load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN ISA PORT=320 NAME=<name2> FRAME=<frametype>

or

load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN PNP SLOT=10008 NAME=<name1> FRAME=<frametype>
load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN PNP SLOT=10010 NAME=<name2> FRAME=<frametype>

where ISA and PNP are used as described above.  <name1> and <name2> are
user specified names that you assign to distinguish the multiple adapters.

The FRAME parameter is optional.  The default frame type is Ethernet_802.2.
If you want the ODI server driver to support more than one frame type, then
both the unique NAME= and FRAME= parameters must be paired on each load
driver line.  The valid frame types are Ethernet_802.2, Ethernet_802.3,
Ethernet_II, and Ethernet_SNAP.

load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN ISA PORT=300 FRAME=Ethernet_802.3 NAME=ADPONE
load C:\SERVER\3C5X9.LAN PNP SLOT=10008 FRAME=Ethernet_II NAME=ADPTWO
bind IPX to ADPONE
bind IP to ADPTWO

The protocols used in this example require other parameters to work
properly.  Consult the appropriate Novell NetWare manuals for details.
