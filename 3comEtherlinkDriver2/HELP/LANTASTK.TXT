Artisoft LANtastic Version 7.0
------------------------------

This procedure describes how to install Artisoft LANtastic 7.0 under Microsoft
Windows using the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA NDIS 2 driver. To install LANtastic 7.0
follow the steps below:


LANtastic 7.0, Windows 3.1x Installation Procedure
--------------------------------------------------

1. Insert the LANtastic 7.0 CD-ROM or diskettes into the appropriate drive.
In Windows 3.1x select File - Run... from the Program Manager menu and type
A:\SETUP. In Windows '95 click Start on the Taskbar, select Run... and type
A:\SETUP. (A denotes the letter of the drive you are installing LANtastic
from).

2. Follow the instructions on the screen and complete all registration
information, serial number and verification key, and other information that
will identify your computer on your network when prompted.

3. LANtastic 7.0 gives you the option to configure your PC as a Server as
well as a Client to the rest of your network. This option is selected as
follows during the installation.

Under the window entitled LANtastic 7.0 Setup you will find the option
"Share this computer's drives & printers (run server)". Check the box next
to this option if you wish to configure your PC as a server as well as a
client. If you chose not to select this option your PC will be configured as
a client only.

Note that during the installation, LANtastic 7.0 gives you other options as
well, such as, "Allow connections to Windows for Workgroups or Windows '95
networks", "Allow connections to existing Novell Servers", "Enable HP
JetDirect printer support", Modem sharing options, TCP/IP support, and
Internet Gateway Service on your PC. Check the box next to each option that
you wish to install during LANtastic 7.0 Setup.

4. After you have selected the appropriate options that you want LANtastic
to install you will need to setup and configure your 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA
NIC.  LANtastic 7.0 Setup will display the following options for your
Ethernet NIC.

        Artisoft NodeRunner Pro Adapter
        Artisoft NodeRunner Adapter
        Common Adapters
        NDIS Support for Artisoft Adapters
        Use NDIS Driver for Non-Artisoft Adapter

Note that the setup option "Allow connections to existing Novell servers"
from step 3 works only with Artisoft NodeRunner Adapters. If you have
selected this option you will not be able to choose any other type of
adapter to install. You must go back and un-select this option in order to
install the driver for the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA NIC.

5. Select the last option for the type of NIC driver that you want to
install i.e. "Use NDIS Driver for Non-Artisoft Adapter". Type the letter of
your floppy drive and insert the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA driver diskette. Then
click on Search. The program will display the name of your 3Com EtherLink
10 ISA NIC at the top of the LANtastic 7.0 Setup window. Click OK to confirm
this selection and then click INSTALL to copy the LANtastic files from the
CD-ROM or diskettes to your hard disk.

6. At the end of the installation select Restart the computer. This will
close Windows and reboot your PC. LANtastic should be installed and
configured when you start Windows. For additional information on setting up
shares and using LANtastic refer to your Artisoft LANtastic User's Manual.


LANtastic 7.0, Windows '95 Installation Procedure
-------------------------------------------------

Under Windows '95 the installation of LANtastic 7.0 is slightly different
than that for Windows 3.1x. The reason is that Windows '95 installs and
configures your 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA NIC automatically. Thus, LANtastic
retrieves the NIC driver information from Windows without the need for user
intervention.

To install and configure LANtastic 7.0 under Windows '95, follow steps 1, 2,
 3, and 6 from the list above.  Your NIC configuration will be incorporated
into LANtastic automatically from your Windows '95 setup.
