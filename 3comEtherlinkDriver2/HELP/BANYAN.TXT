                  Banyan VINES Installation Notes


Preliminary Banyan VINES Client Installation
--------------------------------------
The Banyan VINES LAN software installation requires that you input the IRQ
assigned to the NIC.

To determine the IRQ, perform the following steps:

1.  Insert the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA EtherDisk #2 diskette in the floppy
    drive and make that the active drive.

2.  At the DOS prompt type:
     3C5X9CFG [Enter]

3.  When the main menu appears, select Adapter Configuration and press
    [Enter].

4.  The Adapter Configuration screen appears with the IRQ shown in the
    Standard Options box.


Banyan VINES Client Installation
--------------------------
To install VINES 6.0 software on a DOS NDIS workstation, follow these
instructions.  DOS must be installed on the target workstation C: drive or
you must have a bootable DOS floppy.

1.  Use the DOS MD command to create a subdirectory called \VINES.

2.  Copy the contents of the VINES LAN S/W (DOS) Install diskette into
    the \VINES subdirectory.

3.  Copy the contents of the NDIS subdirectory on the VINES LAN S/W (DOS)
    2 of 2 diskette into the \VINES subdirectory.

4.  Copy the ELNK3.DOS and the PROTOCOL.INI fragment from the NDIS2\DOS
    subdirectory on the EtherDisk #2 diskette to the \VINES subdirectory.

5.  Edit the PROTOCOL.INI file to read as follows:

    [PROTOCOL MANAGER]
     DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$

    [VINES_XIF]
     DRIVERNAME = NDISBAN$
     BINDINGS = ELNK3

    [ELNK3]
     DRIVERNAME = ELNK3$

6.  Run the PCCONFIG.EXE program located in the \VINES subdirectory.

7.  Select option 1, Network Card Settings.

8.  Select the NDIS Ethernet option.

9.  The NDIS Workstation screen appears. Enter the interrupt request
    number (IRQ) you selected for the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA NIC.

10.  Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add the following lines, substituting
     A: for C: for a floppy disk installation.

     DEVICE = C:\VINES\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\VINES
     DEVICE = C:\VINES\ELNK3.DOS

11. Insert the following lines in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

     CD \VINES
     BAN

     BAN loads the NDISBAN drivers and reads the PCCONFIG.DB file to
     invoke changes made during the PCCONFIG stage.
