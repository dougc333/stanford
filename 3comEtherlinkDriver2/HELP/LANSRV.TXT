IBM LAN Server v4.0 for OS/2
----------------------------

This procedure describes how to install the NDIS driver for LAN Server 4.0.
OS/2 must be already installed on your computer.  To install the NDIS driver
for the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA NIC, follow these steps:

 1. Open an OS/2 prompt.

 2. Insert the LAN Server MPTS (Multi-Protocol Transport
    Services) disk 1 in your floppy drive.

 3. Make that drive your current drive.  Type:
       A: [Enter]

 4. Type:
    Install [Enter]

 5. Select OK.

 6. Select Install.

 7. Select a target drive and then choose OK.

    The default drive is C.

 8. Insert disk 2 when prompted and select OK.

 9. Select OK when the MPTS installation is complete.

10. Select Configure.

11. Select LAN Adapters and Protocols
    and then choose Configure.

12. Select Other Adapters and then choose OK.

13. Insert the 3Com EtherDisk diskette #2 in the
    floppy drive and enter the drive letter and path to
    the 3Com NDIS drivers.  For example, type:

      A:\NDIS\OS2

14. Select OK.

15. Select 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA family adapter for
    OS/2 and then choose Add.

16. Under Current Configuration, select 3Com
    EtherLink 10 ISA adapter for OS/2 and then choose
    Edit.

17. Enter the 12-digit address of your EtherLink
    10 ISA Family adapter and then choose OK.

      The address is found on the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA adapter
      following the characters EA=.

18. Select the protocol(s) you will be using with
    your network and then choose Add.

19. Select your protocol(s) under Current
    Configuration and then choose Edit.

20. Enter the 12-digit address of your
    EtherLink 10 ISA Family adapter and then choose OK.

21. Select  OK.

22. Select  Close.

23. Select  Exit.

24. Select Update CONFIG.SYS and choose Exit.

25. Select OK.

26. Select Exit.

27. Quit OS/2 and reboot for the changes to take effect.

28. Follow the IBM instructions on installing
    LAN Server to complete the installation.


IBM LAN Server v4.0 for DOS
---------------------------
IBM DOS LAN Services Install v4.0


1.  Insert the disk labeled DOS LAN Services Disk 1 into your disk drive.

2.  Change to that drive and type:

    INSTALL

3.  Choose the directory where you want the software installed.
    The default is C:\NET.

4.  A menu appears that provides a list of network cards.
    Choose "Network card not shown in the list below..."

5.  Type:

    A:\NDIS2\DOS

    Remove the DOS LAN Services Disk 1 diskette and insert the EtherDisk
    diskette #2.

6.  The next menu should display 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA Family.

7.  Additional menus will appear.
    Choose the appropriate options for your network environment. Refer
    to the IBM manual if there are questions regarding these menus.

8.  After completing the installation, you must copy ELNK3.DOS to C:\NET
    before rebooting.

IBM LAN Support Program for DOS
-------------------------------


The following depict examples of using the IBM LAN Support program with the
3Com EtherLink 10 ISA adapter.  To acquire the latest version of LAN Support,
downloads are available from IBM's FTP site at:

www.raleigh.ibm.com/pub/products/lanprods/lantran/lsp138.exe.

Version1.38 is the latest version available at the time of this readme file.
For installation instructions and assistance, please refer to IBM for more
information.

(Note:  The example files below shows the minimum lines necessary for LAN
Support.  Your configuration files may be different than the ones below.)
