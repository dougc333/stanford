                     EtherDisk (R) Diskette for
                   The EtherLink 10 ISA NIC Family
          NDIS 2.01 Drivers and Windows for Workgroups 3.11


The following describes the procedure for installing the real-mode 16-bit
NDIS2 (ELNK3.DOS) driver under Windows for Workgroups (WFW).  Real-mode
drivers are required by DOS networking applications.

NOTE: It is assumed that Windows for Workgroups has already been
      installed.

1.  Start Windows.

2.  Open the Network group and double-click Network Setup.

3.  To install the network driver, click Drivers...

4.  In the Network Drivers window, click Add Adapter...

5.  From the list of network NICs, select Unlisted or Updated Network
    Adapter.

6.  Network setup requires a vendor-provided network driver diskette.
    Insert the EtherDisk diskette #2 in drive A:, and type the path for
    the NDIS driver:

    A:\WFW311

    Then click OK.

7.  From the Unlisted or Updated Network Adapter screen, select 3Com
    EtherLink 10 ISA (3C509b) and click OK.

8.  From the Network Drivers screen, click Setup.

9.  To select the NDIS 2 real-mode driver, click the down arrow under
    Driver Type and select Real Mode NDIS Driver. Then click OK.

10. The Network Setup screen now lists the 3Com EtherLink 10 ISA Adapter
    (3C509b) (NDIS2) along with the default protocol stacks.

11.  The Windows Setup now asks whether you want to replace the Enhanced
     Mode Protocol Manager with the version you are installing now.
     Click Yes to All.

12.  The Windows setup program now asks for the NDIS.386 file. Insert
     Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Disk 7 and click OK.

13.  When prompted for the ELNK3.DOS driver, insert the 3Com EtherDisk
     diskette #2 in the A: drive. To load the NDIS 2 driver, type this path:

     A:\NDIS2\DOS

     Click OK.

14.  The PROTOCOL.INI and SYSTEM.INI files have now been modified.  WFW
     saves the old versions with the extension .001, where the number is
     incremented every time a new PROTOCOL.INI or SYSTEM.INI FILE is
     generated. Click OK.

15.  Restart your system when prompted.
