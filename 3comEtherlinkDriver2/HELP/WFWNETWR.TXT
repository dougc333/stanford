The following steps describe how to install your 3Com network NIC in a
NetWare client running Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

1.  Ensure the card has been configured properly in the computer by
    reviewing the configuration and diagnostic tests.

2.  In Windows for Workgroups, locate the Network section (the Network icon).

    If you are using the Microsoft Windows Network in combination with
    Novell NetWare, do the next step.  If not, skip to step 11.

3.  Click the Network icon and set up the network for Microsoft and Novell
    (3.x or 4.x).

    a.  Click the Network button and select Install Microsoft Windows
            Network and other network.

    b.  Select Novell.

4.  You will be prompted to choose the Novell NetWare drivers.
    Select the recommended driver.

7.  Click OK.  The Install Driver dialog box appears.

8.  At the command line, insert EtherDisk #2 and type in the following
    drive and path:

    A:\WFW311

    This will load the NDIS driver.

9.  Follow the instructions when prompted.

    NOTE: Install the proper support files from your WFW support disk or
          Novell disk when prompted.

10. Reboot the computer.

11. If you are installing only NetWare shell support for Windows for
    Workgroups, ensure that the DOS ODI drivers have been installed.
    (To install the drivers, run the 3Com Intelligent Auto Install program 
    from DOS, or see the section on DOS client install.)

12. In Windows for Workgroups, locate the Network icon and click it.

13. Set up the network by clicking the Network button and selecting Install
    Windows support for the following network only, for example:
    Novell NetWare (Workstation shell 3.x or 4.x).

14. Click OK.

15. Click OK again in the Network Setup window and follow the prompts.

    NOTE: It may be necessary to use your Novell or Windows for Workgroups
          network support diskettes during the installation.
