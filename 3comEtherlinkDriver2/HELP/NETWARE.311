                The EtherLink 10 ISA Adapter Family
           NetWare 3.11 Server Driver Installation Notes


Netware 3.11 is no longer supported on this EtherDisk.  If you need to
install an EtherLink 10 ISA adapter in a Netware 3.11 server, obtain the
LANDR6 support file from Novell and follow the directions in that file
to install a Netware server specification 3.2 driver.

At the very minimum, you will need the following NLMs from LANDR6:

   MSM31X.NLM
   ETHERTSM.NLM
   LSLENH.NLM
   PATCHMAN.NLM
   MONITOR.NLM
